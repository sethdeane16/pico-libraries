This is a template library for raspberry pi pico library development board using a picoprobe. The "library-template" directory is intended to be copied and modified to start a new library.

Specific locations in this directory that will require modification include...
- makeAndLoad.sh (update library, project, and paths)
- CMakeLists.txt (should only need updates if you need additional sdk libraries/hardware) 
- library-template/CMakeLists.txt (update the name of the library)
- demo.c (update the library include file, obviously)

## makeAndLoad.sh
Bash script that should be run from its directory.
Usage: sudo sh makeAndLoad.sh

## demo.c
demo.c contains a simple main program that can be used to run and test the library in the library folder.

## CMakeLists.txt
CmakeLists file responsible for generating demo test program.

## library-template
This folder contains the actual library.
Must contain at least CMakeLists.txt, library-template.c and library-template.h.
May contain additional supporting files for that library.

### library-template/library-template.c
The primary library file should have the name of the library.

### library-template/library-template.h
The accompanying header file.

### library-template/CMakeLists.txt
CmakeLists file for creating an includable library.
